# Digital Image Processing (DIP) Project - Iris Segmentation

Completed by Nico Jared Govindsamy and Mohammed Gathoo on 2022/06/20.

There are two jupyter notebooks, a report and an image dataset containing multiple files.
The two files are visual.ipynb and script.ipynb:
- script.ipynb is our MAIN file containing the entire program in defined functions. This allows you
to run the algorithm multiple times for different images. However, this does not produce intermediate images
during the process.
- That's the purpose of visual.ipynb. Since it isn't in a function format, you need to run the whole notebook
everytime for a different image but it does show images during the various image processing steps.

When reading in a file, make sure to specifiy the correct path, for example "images/blue/blue1.jpg".
The files are sorted such that the file name is the label of the image and it is enumerated from 1 to the total
number of that image.

Please read through the report for an analysis of the results.
